# Test that two nodes and four edges can be added.(complete graph)

# Create a graph
created graph g

# Add two nodes
added node a to g
added node b to g

# Add four edges
added edge aa from a to a in g
added edge bb from b to b in g
added edge ab from a to b in g
added edge ba from b to a in g

# Print nodes and the outgoing edges from a and b
g contains: a b
the children of a in g are: a(aa) b(ab)
the children of b in g are: a(ba) b(bb)
