# Tests that list edges in alphabetic order

# Create graph
created graph g

# Add nodes to g
added node a to g
added node b to g
added node c to g
added node d to g
added node e to g

# Add Edges to g in random order
added edge ac from a to c in g
added edge ae from a to e in g
added edge aa from a to a in g
added edge ab from a to b in g
added edge acc from a to c in g
added edge ad from a to d in g
added edge aee from a to e in g
added edge aeee from a to e in g

# List the children of a in g
the children of a in g are: a(aa) b(ab) c(ac) c(acc) d(ad) e(ae) e(aee) e(aeee)
