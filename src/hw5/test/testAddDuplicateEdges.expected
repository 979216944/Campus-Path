# Tests that adding duplicate edges does not affect and corrupt the graph.

# Create graph
created graph g

# Add nodes to g
added node a to g
added node b to g
added node c to g

# Add Edges to g
added edge aa from a to a in g
added edge ab from a to b in g
added edge ac from a to c in g

# Add Duplicate Edges to g
added edge aa from a to a in g
added edge ab from a to b in g
added edge ac from a to c in g

# List nodes and the outgoing edges
g contains: a b c
the children of a in g are: a(aa) b(ab) c(ac)
the children of b in g are:
the children of c in g are:
