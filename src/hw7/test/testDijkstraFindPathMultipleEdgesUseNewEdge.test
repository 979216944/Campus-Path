# Test Dijkstra finding a path with multiple edges.
# if a new edge is added to your graph after it is initialized 
# by processing the Marvel data, then the pathfinding algorithm 
# should be able to use this new edge in its calculations.

# Load graph
LoadGraph map map.tsv

# Add edge
AddEdge map location1 location2 0.01

# Find a long path from location1 to location7 and the reverse
FindPath map location1 location7
FindPath map location7 location1
