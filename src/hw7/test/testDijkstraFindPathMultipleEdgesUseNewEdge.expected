# Test Dijkstra finding a path with multiple edges.
# if a new edge is added to your graph after it is initialized 
# by processing the Marvel data, then the pathfinding algorithm 
# should be able to use this new edge in its calculations.

# Load graph
loaded graph map

# Add edge
added edge 0.010 from location1 to location2 in map

# Find a long path from location1 to location7 and the reverse
path from location1 to location7:
location1 to location2 with weight 0.010
location2 to location3 with weight 1.000
location3 to location4 with weight 1.000
location4 to location5 with weight 1.000
location5 to location6 with weight 1.000
location6 to location7 with weight 1.000
total cost: 5.010
path from location7 to location1:
location7 to location6 with weight 1.000
location6 to location5 with weight 1.000
location5 to location4 with weight 1.000
location4 to location3 with weight 1.000
location3 to location2 with weight 1.000
location2 to location1 with weight 1.000
total cost: 6.000
