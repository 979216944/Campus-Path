# Find a minimum-cost path from location1 to location7 and the reverse
path from location1 to location7:
location1 to location8 with weight 1.000
location8 to location7 with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000
path from location7 to location1:
location7 to location8 with weight 1.000
location8 to location1 with weight 1.000
