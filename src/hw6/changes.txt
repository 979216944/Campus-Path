Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from HW5 and why 
those changes were made below.  (See the HW6 assignment for details.)

- I didn't change underlying implementation of DirectedGraph, because my implementation of HashMap and HashSet
are both fast enough. But when I was declaring it, I used the type (like Map and Set) as it's more general to use.
- I also changed the return type of removeEdge to make it more consistent.
- In addition, I changed all exception cases to preconditions, which makes it easier to implement.
- I updated my compareTo method in LabeledEdge by comparing ends first and labels next, 
which is easier to use when sorting. Also, this change also corrects the sorting issue in hw5.
