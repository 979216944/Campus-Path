# Test load a graph with two nodes.

# Load graph
loaded graph twoNodes

# List nodes and their children
twoNodes contains: node1 node2
the children of node1 in twoNodes are: node2(label1)
the children of node2 in twoNodes are: node1(label1)

# Find a path from node1 to node2
path from node1 to node2:
node1 to node2 via label1
